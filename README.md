# GenNitro
⚠️ Im no longer maintaining this script and the rust version, but maybe I'll rewrite my nitro sniper because theres actually somewhat big chance to snipe nitro if used properly. I kinda want to make it good so it will definitely take a while to create.  A fast nitro gen w/ proxy-scraper built-in.
